# Barcode Wallet
This is a barcode wallet application I'm writing on my own. It's for storing barcodes that I come across in my day to day life and using them. 

## Why would you need to store barcodes?
As it turns out, companies love writing useless code. From transport companies to a certain large supermarket chain that will provide lower prices, all of these companies expect you to download their poorly written app just to display a barcode for scanning. Personally, this feels like a waste of space on my phone. **Not everything needs to be an app**.

## So, what's this for?
This react project allows me to store data, and generates barcodes from this data. This way, instead of having 6 badly designed apps, you'll only have 1 (with the added bonus of this one not spying on you). Currently it isn't particularly useful, with no ability to actually store the data or to extract barcodes from images. Still, these are features I intend to implement.
